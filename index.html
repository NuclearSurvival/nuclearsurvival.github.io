   <h1> You want to survive a nuclear attack? You think your country will be engulfed in atomic war? If so, keep these tips in mind and you might survive! </h1>

   <h2> Beforehand Preparation </h2>
   
   <h3> Keep your car off the road. As we all know, cars take up space. Other cars need space. Therefore, you need to keep your car in a garage
   or driveway so others can properly evacuate.  Nobody cares about your survival. We all know Jake is going to lead your nation back to glory. </h3>
  
   <h3> Also, you need to make your house fireproof. Remove any paper from your house.
   While you're at it, rebuild the entire home out of solid granite. That's the best way to survive. </h3>
   
   <h2> If It Actually Happens </h2>
   
   <h3> Only use your telephone for real emergencies. As we all know, nuclear attack isn't a real emergency. Instead, use your phone when
   Uncle Bill drinks too much. That's clearly an emergency. </h3>
   
   <h3> This tip is very important. DON'T START RUMORS. When nuclear fire rains down upon the world, it's important that nobody thinks
   Suzy has been cheating on Josh. </h3>
   
   <h3> By the way, trust your local radiological defense team. There's no need to get a Geiger counter yourself, just trust them!
   After all, every city clearly has such a team just waiting for atomic attack, and there's no way they could die! </h3>
   
   <h3> Next, never forget that radiation isn't dangerous. Just take a shower! All that fallout will come right off, and then you will be fine!
   All you need to do afterwards is endure the vomiting, confusion, fatigue, headache, nausea, bleeding, etc.
   
   <h3> Most importantly, duck and cover. This is your best technique. 
   If you curl up into a ball near a wall or under a table, you will be invincible!</h3>
